# Catan
Creating a balanced catan board setup with random hexes and number tokens each time.
Makes sure no particular intersections/areas of the board/particular resources are too rich or too poor.
Avoids hexes of the same resource being all next to each other or getting the same number tokens.
Customizable as per needs.
